# Project 3

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Premise

This is an ordering site for Pinocchio's Pizza. It allows users to create an
account and login, view the menu, and submit their order.

## Additional Information

I got a bit stuck on how to store addons and toppings this time. I also didn't
sitck to my schedule as well as I would have liked to. As a result, things don't
look quite as pretty as I would have hoped and there's probably a redundant
snippet of code that I missed.

## Personal Touch

For my personal touch, I allowed users to view their past orders.
